Hawkular-APM
============

This project is now ARCHIVED and deprecated in favor of [CNCF's Jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger).
See our announcement [blog post](http://www.hawkular.org/blog/2017/04/19/hawkular-apm-jaeger.html) for more details.

Hawkular APM is the **Application Performance Management** solution offering:

* Distributed Tracing (e.g. for microservices)
* Application Performance Management
* Business Transaction Management (currently only using JVM javaagent based approach)

Applications can be instrumented using the [OpenTracing standard API](http://opentracing.io/), optionally with the help of
framework integrations and a non-intrusive Java Agent, that can be found
in the [OpenTracing contrib organization](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib). It is also possible to use Hawkular
APM as an alternative backend for [Zipkin client libraries](http://zipkin.io/pages/existing_instrumentations.html).

Hawkular APM provides the capabilities to monitor the flow of invocations
across servers, tiers, on-premises and in the cloud. It also enables detailed
performance analysis to be performed of the individual components that make up an
application.

Project documentation can be found [here](https://hawkular.gitbooks.io/hawkular-apm-user-guide/content/).

Build & Run
-----------

To build and run execute:

```shell
$ mvn clean install -Pdev -DskipTests [-Pitest]
$ dist/target/hawkular-apm-${version}/bin/standalone.sh [-Djboss.http.port=9411]

-> go to http://localhost:[8080|9411]/ and log in with admin:password
```

The parameters to these commands are:

* `-Djboss.http.port=9411` - bind APM port to [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io/) 9411 port. Default APM port is 8080.
* `-Pdev` - create user admin:password
* `-Pitest` - run integration tests

Add non-intrusive Java instrumentation to instrument your applications ([doc](https://hawkular.gitbooks.io/hawkular-apm-user-guide/content/installation/JVMAGENT.html)):
```shell
$ source dist/target/hawkular-apm-${version}/apm/setenv.sh <APM server port>

-> restart your Java applications
```

REST API documentation can be generated using `-Pdocgen` profile. The doc is generated under `rest/target` folder.

```shell
$ mvn clean install -Pdocgen
```

Project Structure
-----------------

The project is divided into several areas:

Folder | Description
---- | ----
**api** | This module contains the Java interfaces for services and processors, as well as the information model for exchanging business transaction information.
**client** | This folder contains the modules used to collector information from an execution environment.
**dist** | This module builds a distribution containing a pre-packaged Hawkular server with APM installed.
**examples** | This folder contains example applications.
**server** | This folder contains the modules related to the server.
**tests** | This folder contains the integration tests.
**ui** | The angularjs based user interface.
